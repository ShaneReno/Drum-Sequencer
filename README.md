# Drum Sequencer
This document will outline and detail the purpose of, and how to use the programmable drum sequencer - a project by Shane Reynolds.
## What is it?
A programmable drum sequencer is a digital instrument that plays rhythmic and percussive sounds in a 2-bar loop, allowing users to select a pattern of 1/4 notes to play. Each loop of the sequence consists of 8 steps, and if a drum is present in that step, the sequencer will output the corresponding sound.
### Technologies used
The project was constructed using:
* HTML 
* CSS 
* Bootstrap, and
* JavaScript

## Features
The drum sequencer features the following main features:
* **Sequencer time** - a neon green LED that loops from left to right, indicating the current beat in the bar that the drum sequencer will play. It allows the user to keep track of where they are in the sequence, and make pattern adjustments if needed.

* **Four instrument channels** - you can choose to program a) _Kick_, b) _Snare_, c), _Clap_ and d) _Cowbell_, all in live time. Simply click on an instrument channel block in order to program it.

* **Play and Stop buttons** - ability to start and hault the sequence.
* **Beat/bar measure** - a live counter informing you about the current beat and bar ratio.
* **Metronome** - audible ticking to time each beat.
* **Beats per minute input** - ability to alter how fast the tempo is. Choose between 60 BPM and 160 BPM.
